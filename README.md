# pastelbracelet

pastel bracelet that I'm making for a fundraiser! colors: lavender, baby pink, light green, light blue

adjustable chevron pattern


most likely gonna sell for $1.50 or $2 (I wish I could sell it for more because it took  2 hours to make, but I don't think people will buy it then)
